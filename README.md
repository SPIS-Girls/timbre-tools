### Timbre Tools Hackathon 2024

This repository contains source code and assets of the project made by **SPIS Girls** for Timbre Tools 2024 Hackathon.

## What is the project about?
### Inspiration
The project comes in a form of a Max Patch. It is a **timbre** manipulation tool that allows the users to interact with a timbre the same way they would interact with a phsyical object. The main inspiration behind the project was a sonic interaction and a live performance (_#sensingtimbre_, _#timbrecheck_, _#timbreforall_).

### Technical Overview
The way the audio is modified depends on a camera input. More specifically, the tool extracts visual properties of the live video feed from the webcam (color space, brightness, presence and a full spectogram). The intensity of the extracted features controls timbre manipulating audio effects. Additionally, audio input is convolved with the camera input adding unpredictable factor to the whole system.

Video feature extraction and FFT calculations are computer in a real-time JUCE plugin. The plugin is plugged to the MaxMSP Patch. In the patch certain effects and their parameters are controlled by the values generated by the JUCE plugin.
